## About

TMux Commander is a mix of *TMux* and *Midnight Commander*.

The overall goal is to provide the user a mc-like interface, that browses and performs tmux actions.

Just like MC, TMux Commander is meant to be used as a Linux package, and ran by typing "tc".

### Why

**Convenience and time-saving**:
Much like Git, tmux sessions can be in a complicated state and require several commands and attention to what you're doing to grasp the whole picture. A GUI can help effortlessly visualize everything at once (like git managers do), and perform actions on specific items.

**No memory-burden**:
tmux's key-shortcuts are quite different from other common tools', so rather than learn/set a bunch of shortcuts that can interfere with your muscle-memory in other programs, you could use a GUI that offers the same operations. It might also be convenient for tmux-beginners, as the GUI introduces the various options.

**Extra functionalities**: 
One problem/benefit of tmux is that its sessions are temporary; they disappear after a restart. A GUI can offer a more organized workframe, with browser-like features; namely save/load.

### Project status

At the very start. The idea exists, but not implemented.
